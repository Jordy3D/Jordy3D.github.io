                <p>This is an interactive page that allows you to keep track of which Pokémon you have caught the
                    Pokémon MasterDex Challenge.</p>
                <h4>Functions</h4>
                <ul>

                    <li>Save your progress to your browser's localstorage.</li>
                    <li>Export and Import your progress to a JSON file.</li>
                    <li>Search for a Pokémon by typing in the search bar.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Key</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Grey Pokémon have not been caught.</li>
                    <li>Green Pokémon have been caught.</li>
                    <li>Yellow Pokémon are outliers. These are Pokémon that are not obtained in a normal way, or are
                        very specific.</li>

                        This page makes use of localstorage. If you clear your browser's cache, your progress will be

                        unless you have previously exported your progress.

                        At the time of writing, Paldea is not included in the MasterDex Challenge as it is not supported
                        by HOME. The information below is my best guess as to what may be included in the future.

            <hr>
            <p>As the series is always gonna be adding new things to the Dex, some Box positions and the like will likely change below to reflect that. Padding has been alloted to minimise this, and any box overflows will likely just require moving whole boxes at a time rather than shuffling individuals too much, at least for Primary mons.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Vivillon</b><br>
                    With the addition of Vivillon patterns showing up in relation to Postcards from GO, they may be considered a "more interesting" way to obtain them, so their Source may be changed to GO and/or Scarlet and Violet.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Upcoming DLC</b><br>
                    The DLC will be adding new Pokémon to the game. These will be added to the list once they are released. Any that are new evolutions of existing mons will be marked with the appropriate Source.
