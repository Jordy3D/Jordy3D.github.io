                <p>This is an interactive page that allows you to keep track of which Pokémon you have caught the
                    Pokémon MasterDex Challenge.</p>

                    <li>Save your progress to your browser's localstorage.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Grey Pokémon have not been caught.</li>
                    <li>Green Pokémon have been caught.</li>
                    <li>Yellow Pokémon are outliers. These are Pokémon that are not obtained in a normal way, or are
                        very specific.</li>

                        This page makes use of localstorage. If you clear your browser's cache, your progress will be
                        lost
                        unless you have previously exported your progress.

                        Much of the data used on this page is from Bird Keeper Toby's spreadsheet. You can find the most
                        recent video about the MasterDex Challenge <a

                        The Konami Code will clear localstorage and reload the page.

                        At the time of writing, Paldea is not included in the MasterDex Challenge as it is not supported
                        by HOME. The information below is my best guess as to what may be included in the future.
